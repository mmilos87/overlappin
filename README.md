# overlappin
Java generic interface

ComparableSlot is a generic interface for solving the overlap problem in a collection of objects that have slot start and end attributes.

Slot attributes must implement the Comparable interface.

ComparableSlot has factory methods that allow to get information about the overlap in the collection, information about where the overlap occurred as well as grouping the object by some attribute and then checking for the overlap.
